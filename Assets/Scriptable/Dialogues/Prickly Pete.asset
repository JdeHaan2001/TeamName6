  Dialogue:
  - Hello! Gain Quest
  - 'You are in the biggest social city in the world, the place where the least social
    person can become an internet sensation. How have you never heard of socialite
    stad?

'
  - 'Did you forget my name already? I am Prickly Pete. I will be your guide and
    will help you through the city.

'
  - 'I could not tell you even if I wanted to, people just appear in this city every
    now and then and no one knows how.

'
  - 'Ahh straight to the point, I like it! You are here because you need to become
    the biggest sensation in this world, you need to do this by getting followers
    and you get followers by doing missions/quests.

'
  - "Wanting to start already! I haven't seen someone this enthusiastic in a long
    time. Before you actually can get started with exploring the city and starting
    getting famous, you need to get a phone to get access to social media. Lucky
    for you I know someone who can give you a phone. You will need to pick it up
    yourself though. You will get rewarded for  \n"
