  Dialogue:
  - "Hmm, hello, you woke me up so you better have a good reason to be here.\r"
  - "I could have seen it coming. It is always someone being sent by Pete and they
    always need a phone. It is never just how are you Boris it is always gets me
    a phone. But because I am feeling nice I will get you one, just let me get it.\r\nHere
    you go! Now go start your adventure so I can go back to bed.\r"
  - "Ey, that is not nice is it? I am not going to give you the phone if you talk
    to me like that. Before I give you the phone you need to apologize.\r"
  - "That\u2019s more like it, next time you meet someone maybe don\u2019t be so
    harsh to them, not everyone is going to accept an apology like me. But because
    I am feeling nice I will get you one, just let me get it."
  - "Ugh I can\u2019t be bothered, next time you come here acting like this I won\u2019t
    give you what you want. You are lucky that I'm tired and can\u2019t be bothered."
