                "I could not tell you even if I wanted to, people just appear in this city every now and then and no one knows how.",

                "Ahh straight to the point, I like it! You are here because you need to become the biggest sensation in this world, you need to do this by getting followers and you get followers by doing missions/quests.",

                "Wanting to start already! I haven't seen someone this enthusiastic in a long time. Before you actually can get started with exploring the city and starting getting famous, you need to get a phone to get access to social media. Lucky for you I know someone who can give you a phone. You will need to pick it up yourself though. You will get rewarded for  1!"
